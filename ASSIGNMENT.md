# Assignment
All teams will work simultaneously on the same frontend monolith. Each team will work on a new feature. Go as far as you want to go with the feature you are implementing, but make sure you got something to deliver within the duration of the workshop, because every team will have a short moment to pitch their new feature.Be careful, because there is a chance you are touching the code of another end2end team. So keep your commits small!

Given the fact that every team has +/- 10 members, how will you collaborate? And how far will you go with the feature?

Good luck.

## Guidelines
There are plenty of things you can work on, even for the smallest features. Think about input validation, error handling, auto suggestions, automated tests, improving design, accessibility, maintainability, and so on. But feel free to be creative with the feature you are implementing.

## Mob / Pair programming

Given the amount of engineers per team, make sure to make use of mob/pair programming. Code on a feature, switch seats, talk about it, and learn from each other.
